               --------  EXAMPLE MENU SYSTEM --------

 This menu is strictly for PXE demonstration purposes and provided as part
 of an automation script that illustrates the setup of a PXE boot server
 on a Linux system.

 I created the script as a coding example for prospective employers.

 Use of this example for any other purposes is *NOT* recommended primarily
 because the example is *simple* and only shows one of a possible hundred
 ways PXE and the related protocols used in its support could be
 configured.

 NOTE: This is *not* kickstart or jumpstart or any other kind of system
   building process. These technologies can be built upon PXE but they are
   not PXE.
