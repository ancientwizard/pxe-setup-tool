 This example demonstrates the automatic setup of several services needed to enable
 PXE booting on the local subnet. It includes example menus. While you can navigate
 the menus none of them will do anything unless you provide the missing images.

  Example: Placing a bootable DOS floppy image in the proper location as
           defined in the menu will boot the system/VM to a DOS prompt.
           Some ISO images may be booted in the same way.
