 This example demonstrates the automatic setup of several services needed to
 enable PXE booting on the local subnet. It includes example menus. While you
 can navigate the menus most of them will do nothing unless you provide the
 missing images and adjust the arguments.

 Example: I have included bootable floppy images in the proper location as
          defined in the menu that boot the system/VM to a prompt (DOS/Grub).
          Some ISO images may be booted in the same way. I plan to create
          future projects(s) that will bring some of the menus to life
          illustrating OS installs, manual and automated, such as kickstart,
          autoyast and preseeding.

 How to get started:
 1) build a bare Linux system (RedHat, CentOS, openSUSE) - see source for list
 2) pull the script
    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ancientwizard/pxe-setup-tool/master/bin/pxe-setup
 3) and run it
    # chmod 0755 pxe-setup; ./pxe-setup
    -- snip --
 4) PXE boot another system who's MAC is defined in the dhcpd.conf file
    and the magic should happen.

 Working Menu Items:
   Debian - Auto builds a minimal Debian server from scratch using preseeding.
            It prompts you with a suggested hostname which you could fully automate.
            You will find instructions in the menu file to fulfill kernel & initrd
            requirements.
